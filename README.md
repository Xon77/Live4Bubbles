# üìñ Overview

---

This project is an extension and modified version based on [SuperDirMixer](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer) from Thomas Grund. But, it is not just a mixer for Tidal. 
It also allows you to control lines of code in Tidal and tons of parameters (tempo, duration, buffer folder and file, functions on the patterns and effects) within Tidal and SuperCollider.

---

# üíø Installation

---

1. You have to install SuperDirtMixer. Therefore follow the instructions in SuperDirtMixer to install [its requirements](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements), like Tidal Cycles and SuperDirt Quark.

2. You have to put the folder [L4B_SC_Extensions](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/tree/main/L4B_SC_Extensions) into your SuperCollider extensions folder.

3. You have to evaluate the 3 steps within the file [ControlTidal.tidal](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/blob/main/L4B_Tidal/ControlTidal.tidal) within Pulsar, open the file [DJCode1.tidal](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/blob/main/L4B_Tidal/DJCode1.tidal) in the first tab of Pulsar, as well as the other files in the following tabs, to be able to Tidal code lines.

4. The path of the sound folder has to structured in the same way as the [sound data base of my other project _Live 4 Life_](https://github.com/Xon77/L4LSoundsDataBase/tree/main/SoundFolder), except that the space should be replaced by "_", like "DB_MBass".

# üìö References

This project, briefly introduced during Composite Montr√©al in June 2025 through a 5-minute pitch, has been presented in October 2025 as part of a three-hour public experimental workshop at [Eastern Bloc](https://www.easternbloc.ca). The event included a short performance and a participatory exploration session with the audience. I warmly thank Eastern Bloc and [CALQ](https://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/en/) for their support in making this presentation possible.

# üôè Acknowledgements

---


As [mentioned in my previous project](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life?tab=readme-ov-file#acknowledgements) **_Live 4 Life_**, I would have been unable to build this tool without the help of the SuperCollider online community, who always answered my questions and even provided me with some examples of codes and classes. 

I would like to especially thank Thomas Grund, without whom this project would not have come to life‚Äînot only thanks to the Quark [SuperDirMixer](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer) but also for implementing the feature allowing the evaluation of Tidal code lines in Atom/Pulsar, which I had suggested on [Github](https://github.com/tidalcycles/pulsar-tidalcycles/issues/119).

Last, but not least, I would like to thank [CALQ](https://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/en/), who supported me in this project.
