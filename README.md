## Overview

Project to come on controlling Live Coding.

This project is an extension of [SuperDirMixer](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer) from Thomas Grund. But, it is not just a mixer for Tidal, but allows you to control lines of code in Tidal and  tons of parameters (tempo, duration, buffer folder and file, functions on the patterns and effects).

## Installation

1. You have to install SuperDirtMixer and therefore follow the instructions in SuperDirtMixer to install [its requirements](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements), like Tidal Cycles and SuperDirt Quark.

2. You have to put the folder [L4B_SC_Extensions](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/tree/main/L4B_SC_Extensions) into your SiperCollider extensions folder.

3. You have to evaluate the 3 steps within the file [ControlTidal.tidal](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/blob/main/L4B_Tidal/ControlTidal.tidal) within Pulsar, open the file [DJCode1.tidal](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Bubbles/blob/main/L4B_Tidal/DJCode1.tidal) in the first tab of Pulsat to be able to Tidal code lines.

4. The path of the sound folder has to structured in the same way as the [sound data base of my other project _Live 4 Life_](https://github.com/Xon77/L4LSoundsDataBase/tree/main/SoundFolder), except that the space should be replaced by "_", like "DB_MBass".

**More to come in the following months in May 2025. Be patient.**
