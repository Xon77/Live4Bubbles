## Licence

Project to come on controlling Live Coding.

This project is an extension of [SuperDirMixer](https://github.com/thgrund/SuperDirtMixer) from Thomas Grund. But, it is not just a mixer for Tidal, but allows you to control lines of code in Tidal and  tons of parameters (tempo, duration, buffer folder and file, functions on the patterns and effects).

You need to follow the instructions to install SuperDirtMixer to set up this project.

(This restriction will be withdrawn only if I have the opportunity to play improvisations in their dome with an appropriate allowance. However, it will surely never happen, since I am no longer interested to send them applications and I am looking for more open spaces. But, Life is unpredictable;)
